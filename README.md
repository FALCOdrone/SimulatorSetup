# SimulatorSetup
Udacity simulator setup and event driven programming

## Prerequisites

Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Download the version of the simulator that's appropriate for your operating system [from this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator/releases).

## How to install

We are going to cloe the udacity github repo and create a conda environment to manage all the packages.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git
cd FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit
```

```shell
git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git
cd FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit
```

On windows `meta_windows_patch.yml` rename `meta.yml`

The next step will take around 30 min to complete

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```



## How to use

```shell
source activate fcnd
```

Download this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PoliDrone/SimulatorSetup.git
cd SimulatorSetup
```

Now open the simulator app and choose backyard flyer mode and on the shell start the code with the following command:

```shell
python3 backyard_flyer.py
```
